      <description>Valve recently announced their latest hardware product, the Steam Deck. A handheld &amp;ldquo;gaming PC&amp;rdquo; similar in shape and function to a Nintendo Switch except it isn&amp;rsquo;t a locked down OS. In fact it will be running the new SteamOS which apparently is now based on Arch Linux as opposed to the previous Debian based attempts.
A lot of Linux users are showing interest in the device, which is understandable given it is a unique product in the Linux space.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Modern video games are an industrialised product that satisfies checklists at the cost of a unique identity and product. They are deceptively marketted and maliciously monetized.
Occasionally a video game will come out that is just trying to be a fun video game. These are few and far between.
This is not a nostalgia post, modern video games are genuinely terrible.
Why do they suck? The simple answer and the correct one is: money.</description>
