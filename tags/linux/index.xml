      <description>Libre, not gratis.
I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the specifics of Free Software in this article, if you would like to know more check the references at the bottom of the page.
Freedom is non-negotiable Your freedom as a user is the most important aspect of the software that you use.
A common phrase found online regarding services such as search engines and email service providers goes something like &amp;ldquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you are the product&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Valve recently announced their latest hardware product, the Steam Deck. A handheld &amp;ldquo;gaming PC&amp;rdquo; similar in shape and function to a Nintendo Switch except it isn&amp;rsquo;t a locked down OS. In fact it will be running the new SteamOS which apparently is now based on Arch Linux as opposed to the previous Debian based attempts.
A lot of Linux users are showing interest in the device, which is understandable given it is a unique product in the Linux space.</description>
