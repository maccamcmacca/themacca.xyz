      <description>&lt;p&gt;XMPP chatting is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact me at &lt;a href=&#34;xmpp:w@dunkelheit.biz&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;w@dunkelheit.biz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration is not available at this time. I would recommend that you host your own XMPP service anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn how to host your own XMPP server at &lt;a href=&#34;https://landchad.net&#34;&gt;landchad.net&lt;/a&gt; or by watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot_EmQ8xdJw&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; by Mental Outlaw.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free As In Freedom</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/free-as-in-freedom.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/free-as-in-freedom.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Libre, not gratis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the specifics of Free Software in this article, if you would like to know more check the &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;freedom-is-non-negotiable&#34;&gt;Freedom is non-negotiable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;memeright&#34; src=&#34;freedom.webp&#34; alt=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34; title=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your freedom as a user is the most important aspect of the software that you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common phrase found online regarding services such as search engines and email service providers goes something like &amp;ldquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you are the product&amp;rdquo;. This is a fairly good summary as it implies (accurately) that these service providers see &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; as an extension of their property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with this statement is the implication that software that is paid for will respect your rights. This is of course not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is straightforward. Don&amp;rsquo;t use them. I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting a boycott (boycotts don&amp;rsquo;t work lol) I am actually just suggesting that you opt out and choose to use Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-a-change&#34;&gt;Make a change&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant services you can change are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office Suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also consider dropping social media and streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem daunting to have to switch all of your service providers but you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it all at once. In fact if you do it slowly over time that is perfectly fine. You may find that you have to do so anyway if you keep on top of sanitising your email inbox, have ongoing projects or need access to a given social media platform to stay in contact with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case you may wish to get them onboard with switching to Free Software and Libre services too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every proprietary service you currently use likely has a Free Software equivalent. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then you probably never needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regarding-video-games-and-drm&#34;&gt;Regarding Video Games and DRM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video games are almost always proprietary. If you want to play them there are ways to do so on Linux including native Linux binaries. However for those that don&amp;rsquo;t have native binaries you may experience issues with their &amp;ldquo;Anti-Cheat&amp;rdquo; or DRM. I recommend just not buying games that have intrusive layers like that in the first place, it is unacceptable for these companies to treat customers this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. Buy an SD card instead, store your music on that and stick it in your phone. Streaming services take your money and give you nothing in return, you do not own what you &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; they are ripping you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-be-fooled&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source and Free Software are not the same thing and whilst many Open Source programs would fit the definition of Free Software in practice this is not true of all Open Source programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the popular editing suite Visual Studio Code is not free software due to its inclusion of anti-features such as telemetry and centralisation of integrated services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is Telegram, the client software uses a modified GPL3 that makes it non-free and the server software is completely proprietary. Telegram is fundamentally no different from using WhatsApp in terms of user freedoms and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that Android devices are &amp;ldquo;Free&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; but this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. Out of the box these devices do not run Free Software or Open Source software. They run proprietary builds of a semi-open source project but the closed source proprietary nature of the out of the box device makes it a non-free device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these devices can be modified with Free and Open Source Android forks such as LineageOS and GrapheneOS. With GrapheneOS being the superior choice if you own a Google Pixel device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What does the Steam Deck mean?</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/what-does-the-steam-deck-mean.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/what-does-the-steam-deck-mean.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Valve recently announced their latest hardware product, the Steam Deck. A handheld &amp;ldquo;gaming PC&amp;rdquo; similar in shape and function to a Nintendo Switch except it isn&amp;rsquo;t a locked down OS. In fact it will be running the new SteamOS which apparently is now based on Arch Linux as opposed to the previous Debian based attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Linux users are showing interest in the device, which is understandable given it is a unique product in the Linux space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a consensus amongst some online personalities that the Steam Deck is going to be good for Linux or that it will finally convince the &amp;ldquo;normies&amp;rdquo; to give Linux a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is something that I would like to see, I&amp;rsquo;m not convinced and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the people hyping such an idea are either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These devices have some impressive hardware under the hood, especially considering that it will be competing in the same space as the Nintendo Switch. All three devices have the same computing power (on paper), they differ in storage and display quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest end configuration is effectively restricted to small indie games, emulation and slightly older titles. This is due to the storage provided just not being large enough for the large install size of modern games. Now this isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s almost the perfect competitor to the Switch at it&amp;rsquo;s price point and with the open nature of its Linux based OS it will likely be the emulation king for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher end models will be interesting to keep an eye on due to their more suitable storage capacities and speeds as well as the highest end model having a better display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including joysticks alongside touch panels is a great decision as it makes the device suitable for both  traditional PC genres and normal computing tasks in addition to gamepad compatible games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integrated display resolution of 1280x800 is a bit low but it makes sense for a portable device inteded for games. There is a reason the Nintendo Switch doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a 1080p panel and it&amp;rsquo;s the same reason the Steam Deck doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Additionally the device apparently targets 30fps in higher performance games, this is about as much as should be reasonably expected from the device. It&amp;rsquo;s a non-issue as far as I am concerned as games that are more suitable for this platform should run perfectly fine at 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;steam-machines&#34;&gt;Steam Machines:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product is effectively the first true &amp;ldquo;Steam Machine&amp;rdquo; Linux gaming PC. Which was a project from almost a decade ago that was cancelled but has now apparently made a return as a handheld device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valve is bringing back SteamOS, which will now be an Arch Linux based distro which is driving Valve&amp;rsquo;s dedication to getting anti-cheat software to work with Proton. However this is a double edged sword as it effectively eliminates the need for developers to compile and optimise for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another positive is that it is a relatively inexpensive way (current hardware prices) for gamers to get familiar with the idea of using Linux whilst giving them an out of the box working device with (supposedly) no need to tinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally see no real negatives for the consumer from the development of this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to note is that Linux users are not Valve&amp;rsquo;s intended audience for this product. This is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of a handheld instead of a desktop PC was a very clever idea. This allows gamers to get their feet wet with Linux without replacing their existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-windows-virus&#34;&gt;The Windows Virus:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I think this is going to be the &amp;ldquo;Windows killer&amp;rdquo; that it is being hyped up as? No. The &amp;ldquo;Windows only exists due to gaming&amp;rdquo; meme is just a meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if this does bring more people over to Linux on their main computers (and that is the important part) then the device will be a success as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. Do I see this happening at any kind of scale? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact the device will be Linux out of the box is a bold move and I respect that, although now anyone with a glorified GameBoy can now claim &amp;ldquo;I run Arch BTW&amp;rdquo; and that meme is officially dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternative-uses&#34;&gt;Alternative Uses:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of emulation has already came up a lot regarding this device and I see it being popular for this reason alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device will support the installation of a Windows operating system if the owner chooses so. While it would be great if they didn&amp;rsquo;t it is inevitable that some people just won&amp;rsquo;t want to use Linux. On the bright side though there will be users that do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen much discussion about that seems more important and relevant is that in addition to being a games console this device is also a powerful Linux tablet that can compete in the tablet space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the device can handle a decent workload it may even function as a desktop replacement for some users that don&amp;rsquo;t care for high end graphical fidelity. After all it is running a full Linux OS and supports package installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hype-issue&#34;&gt;The Hype Issue:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty clear that a lot of the hype around the Steam Deck is coming from people that are setting themselves up for disappointment. Which is inevitable anyway due to the nature of hyping a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a Gaming PC replacement, this is a gaming PC supplement. You will only really benefit from owning this device if you own a gaming PC already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t pre-order. You have literally no reason to do this. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RSS is Based!</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/rss-is-based.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 08:20:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/rss-is-based.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using Newsboat for RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a proper RSS setup has been on my &amp;ldquo;cozy setup&amp;rdquo; checklist for a while. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much time at all to get it working either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously just used browser plug-ins for this however this approach is terrible in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a proper setup using Newsboat I can truly appreciate RSS feeds and I would recommend using them to anyone that wants to keep up to date with things without engaging with social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-rss&#34;&gt;What is RSS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is an abbreviation of Really Simple Syndication, although this isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rsquo;s original name. Put simply it is a way for you to download a feed from a website and keep up to date with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that instead of using intrusive and manipulated social media feeds to keep up to date with your favourite web feeds you can have it all in one place on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may infact already be using RSS without realising it. Did you know that most podcast apps are just RSS readers with a media player?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using RSS you can completely replace the need for a Google account to keep up to date with your favourite channels. Although adding YouTube channels to an RSS feed isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as blogs or podcasts it is doable and once you have done it once the difficulty ends there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small caveat to this is that YouTube can choose to eliminate RSS feeds at any time so it may be worth keeping a separate list of channels you subscribe to for the inevitable third party solution that pops up if this situation were to arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-use-rss&#34;&gt;Why use RSS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censorship Resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; You get what you subscribed to, no manipulation by algorithms or loss of access based on social media account status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; Every feed you care for in one place, in whatever order you want, categorised, tagged, etc however you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist:&lt;/strong&gt; No need for accounts or web services. Just a list, add or remove as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable:&lt;/strong&gt; You can read the feeds using any client you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; RSS just loads an XML file from a webserver, there is no tracking, javascript, middleman services, etc. You get the feed sent directly to you without the need to identify yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-i-get-started&#34;&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get started by downloading an RSS client. I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;newsboat&lt;/code&gt; - CLI client, highly configurable and easy to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;liferea&lt;/code&gt; - GUI client, highly configurable graphical client, uses GTK+ theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be found in your distro&amp;rsquo;s package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have a client you can start adding your favourite feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add feeds as you go, doing it all at once can be an exhaustive exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a site doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively support RSS you will likely find a tool that can create a feed for you instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sites provide feeds for specific topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the documentation for your chosen client if you need help configuring it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Switching to Markdown Format</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to get comfortable with &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; as a static site generator, I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t made my theme the &amp;ldquo;correct way&amp;rdquo; but for now it works to an acceptable minimum and most importantly the pages it produces are formatted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an issue in that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide if I wanted to use Markdown or HTML when writing blog posts. The issue may seem silly (it is) but my reasons for having it were pretty straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just Works&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to read and write (important for blogging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s intended language (kinda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives me total control via element ids and tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Markdown page elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for very specific inputs into the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate and very flexible control of media inputs (important)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; (currently) supports the use of both at the same time but with some minor issues. Ideally I would prefer to use one standard for blog posts and stick with it. For the sake of uniformity and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I was previously doing when drafting a post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it in Markdown for ease of writing and proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start &lt;code&gt;hugo server -D&lt;/code&gt; so that I can preview the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert everything to HTML in the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check preview again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s all good then publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the issue here should be obvious, I was effectively putting in twice the work for the same result. But this did mean that I had absolute control of the page contents and could ensure certain elements are displayed correctly if I wanted them to have a unique style or position that Markdown itself wouldn&amp;rsquo;t produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realised after the &lt;a href=&#34;learning-german.html&#34;&gt;Learning German&lt;/a&gt; entry that I could just take the HTML output from the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; output. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to eliminate steps 3 and 4 above. The easiest way to do this is to just eliminate HTML conversion of the entire document and use &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; when needed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates steps 3 and 4 as well as allowing me to control elements very specifically when needed and keeps the document readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So going forward all posts will be created this way unless it isn&amp;rsquo;t viable for the post type. All previous posts will be converted too. Top level pages AKA &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; pages will still be written in HTML for functional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the site will now be rendered using the &lt;code&gt;uglyURLs = true&lt;/code&gt; option as I don&amp;rsquo;t like the look of &lt;code&gt;/blog/post-name/index.html&lt;/code&gt; in the file tree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning German</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/learning-german.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/learning-german.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to learn German. I have always had an interest in learning another language but due to the terrible methodology used by the education system and cringe meme apps like DuoLingo I was never motivated enough to stick them out. However I recently came to discover the Michel Thomas method after reading these articles by Luke Smith: &lt;a href=&#34;https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/notes-on-learning-languages&#34;&gt;Notes on Learning Languages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/learning-european-languages-michel-thomas&#34;&gt;Learning European Languages (Michel Thomas)&lt;/a&gt;. I won&amp;rsquo;t bother to sumamrize them here but you should definetely read them if you are interested in learning a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading these articles I was convinced to give the method a try. I will update this post every so often with my thoughts on the method so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-why-german&#34;&gt;So why German?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably the most relevant language for me to learn based on its similarities to English, my musical interests and the location of a lot of my friends. I would love to be able to travel there without being a &amp;ldquo;that guy&amp;rdquo; tourist that just speaks in English the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally I believe that learning German will give me reason to explore other related languages. I have always found languages interesting, who knows maybe one day I will be able to speak to people on every continent? I&amp;rsquo;d also like to put the theory that thinking in multiple languages can give you a better understanding of concepts to the test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video Games Are Over</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/video-games-are-over.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.biz/blog/video-games-are-over.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern video games are an industrialised product that satisfies checklists at the cost of a unique identity and product. They are deceptively marketted and maliciously monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally a video game will come out that is just trying to be a fun video game. These are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a nostalgia post, modern video games are genuinely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-they-suck&#34;&gt;Why do they suck?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer and the correct one is: money. Video games have been watered down and industrialised into a checklist of what sells and what gets social media reactions. Many businesses have been led to believe that social media exposure is free advertising. Anyone with a basic understanding of social media algorithms can tell you why this isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the rise of games as a service has effectively made every video game the same with some aesthetic differences. On top of that these service games are psychologically engineered to encourage you to spend as much time as possible playing their game over the competitor&amp;rsquo;s game as well as spending as much money as possible in their in-game store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; title has become increasingly meaningless as industrial gaming corporations have co-opted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is clearly a desire for video games that are made &amp;ldquo;the old way&amp;rdquo;, games made this way are few and far between and as soon as a developer gets a reputation for making games like this they get acquired by a larger corporation and these types of video game disappear with that acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised video games are produced with the budget of hollywood movies, with checklists (the developers cannot diverge from) of what marketting execs think will sell the product and they would rather divert resources to fighting criticism than taking it on board. All of this results in video games being designed for a an &amp;ldquo;average gamer&amp;rdquo; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;muh-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Muh nostalgia!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older games were designed differently, no one can dispute this. The way that they were designed respected the player&amp;rsquo;s intelligence and their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the technology to rinse your customers didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet so even if the idea did cross someone&amp;rsquo;s mind it wasn&amp;rsquo;t implementable in a meaningful or functional way. This led to video games being designed to be challenging, fun, replayable since they wanted you to come back and buy the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers devised their own ways of competing with one another (the origin of speedruns) but most importantly gamers owned their games, they could loan them to friends, they could sell what they didn&amp;rsquo;t like, they could rent to try, some developers even made demos so you didn&amp;rsquo;t need to rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that every old game was great, of course not. A lot of them probably sucked. But the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t suck are still talked about decades later, they are still played decades later, there are entire communities online dedicated to them that have been around almost as long as the games themselves. You won&amp;rsquo;t see this kind of community building effort for most modern games as they are replaced annually and are designed to be played by people that don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply there are three solutions to the problem of modern games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a better hobby. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t go back and play your video games occasionally but being realistic any &amp;ldquo;hobby&amp;rdquo; that isn&amp;rsquo;t productive isn&amp;rsquo;t healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sit back, relax, enjoy your older video games and wait for this accursed industry to collapse in on itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only support developers that respect you as a customer, you can also download an emulator or get some classics from GOG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is that you recognise that modern games are not designed to be fun, but to be addictive and profitable at your expense.&lt;/p&gt;
