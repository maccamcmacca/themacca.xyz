<p>Valve recently announced their latest hardware product, the Steam Deck. A handheld &ldquo;gaming PC&rdquo; similar in shape and function to a Nintendo Switch except it isn&rsquo;t a locked down OS. In fact it will be running the new SteamOS which apparently is now based on Arch Linux as opposed to the previous Debian based attempts.</p>
<p>A lot of Linux users are showing interest in the device, which is understandable given it is a unique product in the Linux space.</p>
<p>There seems to be a consensus amongst some online personalities that the Steam Deck is going to be good for Linux or that it will finally convince the &ldquo;normies&rdquo; to give Linux a try.</p>
<p>While this is something that I would like to see, I&rsquo;m not convinced and I&rsquo;m not sure the people hyping such an idea are either.</p>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware:</h3>
<p>These devices have some impressive hardware under the hood, especially considering that it will be competing in the same space as the Nintendo Switch. All three devices have the same computing power (on paper), they differ in storage and display quality.</p>
<p>The lowest end configuration is effectively restricted to small indie games, emulation and slightly older titles. This is due to the storage provided just not being large enough for the large install size of modern games. Now this isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, in fact it&rsquo;s almost the perfect competitor to the Switch at it&rsquo;s price point and with the open nature of its Linux based OS it will likely be the emulation king for a long time.</p>
<p>Higher end models will be interesting to keep an eye on due to their more suitable storage capacities and speeds as well as the highest end model having a better display.</p>
<p>Including joysticks alongside touch panels is a great decision as it makes the device suitable for both  traditional PC genres and normal computing tasks in addition to gamepad compatible games.</p>
<p>The integrated display resolution of 1280x800 is a bit low but it makes sense for a portable device inteded for games. There is a reason the Nintendo Switch doesn&rsquo;t have a 1080p panel and it&rsquo;s the same reason the Steam Deck doesn&rsquo;t. Additionally the device apparently targets 30fps in higher performance games, this is about as much as should be reasonably expected from the device. It&rsquo;s a non-issue as far as I am concerned as games that are more suitable for this platform should run perfectly fine at 60fps.</p>
<h3 id="steam-machines">Steam Machines:</h3>
<p>This product is effectively the first true &ldquo;Steam Machine&rdquo; Linux gaming PC. Which was a project from almost a decade ago that was cancelled but has now apparently made a return as a handheld device.</p>
<p>Valve is bringing back SteamOS, which will now be an Arch Linux based distro which is driving Valve&rsquo;s dedication to getting anti-cheat software to work with Proton. However this is a double edged sword as it effectively eliminates the need for developers to compile and optimise for Linux.</p>
<p>Another positive is that it is a relatively inexpensive way (current hardware prices) for gamers to get familiar with the idea of using Linux whilst giving them an out of the box working device with (supposedly) no need to tinker.</p>
<p>I personally see no real negatives for the consumer from the development of this device.</p>
<p>Something to note is that Linux users are not Valve&rsquo;s intended audience for this product. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>The choice of a handheld instead of a desktop PC was a very clever idea. This allows gamers to get their feet wet with Linux without replacing their existing hardware.</p>
<h3 id="the-windows-virus">The Windows Virus:</h3>
<p>Do I think this is going to be the &ldquo;Windows killer&rdquo; that it is being hyped up as? No. The &ldquo;Windows only exists due to gaming&rdquo; meme is just a meme.</p>
<p>However if this does bring more people over to Linux on their main computers (and that is the important part) then the device will be a success as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Do I see this happening at any kind of scale? No.</p>
<p>The fact the device will be Linux out of the box is a bold move and I respect that, although now anyone with a glorified GameBoy can now claim &ldquo;I run Arch BTW&rdquo; and that meme is officially dead.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-uses">Alternative Uses:</h3>
<p>The topic of emulation has already came up a lot regarding this device and I see it being popular for this reason alone.</p>
<p>The device will support the installation of a Windows operating system if the owner chooses so. While it would be great if they didn&rsquo;t it is inevitable that some people just won&rsquo;t want to use Linux. On the bright side though there will be users that do.</p>
<p>One thing that I haven&rsquo;t seen much discussion about that seems more important and relevant is that in addition to being a games console this device is also a powerful Linux tablet that can compete in the tablet space.</p>
<p>If the device can handle a decent workload it may even function as a desktop replacement for some users that don&rsquo;t care for high end graphical fidelity. After all it is running a full Linux OS and supports package installation.</p>
<h3 id="the-hype-issue">The Hype Issue:</h3>
<p>It seems pretty clear that a lot of the hype around the Steam Deck is coming from people that are setting themselves up for disappointment. Which is inevitable anyway due to the nature of hyping a product.</p>
<p>This is not a Gaming PC replacement, this is a gaming PC supplement. You will only really benefit from owning this device if you own a gaming PC already.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t pre-order. You have literally no reason to do this. Ever.</p>
